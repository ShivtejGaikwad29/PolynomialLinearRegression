# PolynomialLinearRegression
Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) is modeled as an (n)th degree polynomial. This model is useful when the data shows a non-linear relationship.

<h4>Polynomial Regression Model</h4>
Objective: To predict the dependent variable (y) based on the independent variable (x) using a polynomial equation of degree (n).

Equation: The polynomial regression equation is given by:
y=β0​+β1​x+β2​x2+β3​x3+…+βn​xn+ϵ
where:

(y) is the dependent variable.
(x) is the independent variable.
(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n) are the coefficients.
(\epsilon) is the error term.
